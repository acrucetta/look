# Feature Roadmap

As a user, I want to:

- [ ] Open the path of the files from the CLI
- [ ] Have an easy to understand score
- [ ] Filter the search by tags or dates
- [ ] Have some NLP in the search to find deeper patterns in the data
- [ ] See a brief highlight of the text within the top results
